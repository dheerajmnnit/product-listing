# Assignment - Product listing page
A responsive UI design for the product listing page.

## Demo


## Tech Stack
- React
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Mock API = dummyjson.com

## Considerations
- Unfortunately, due to constraints in the mock API, the functionality to search within a specific category is not currently achievable. However, rest assured that searching by product name functions seamlessly.


## Running the project
- Clone the project
```
git clone 
```

- Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

- Start server
```
npm run dev
```
